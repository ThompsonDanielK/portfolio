        My name is Daniel Thompson. I am a Software Engineer with a track record
        of developing innovative technical solutions. My career journey has been
        marked by a collaborative spirit, thriving in diverse teams alongside
        engineers, product experts, and designers to fuse ideas into seamless
        solutions. Based in Columbus, Ohio, I recently played a pivotal role at
        eFuse, where I leveraged my expertise in MongoDB, Express, Redis,
        Node.js, React, and GraphQL to bolster an esports tournament platform
        while spearheading SEO and analytics enhancements, contributing
        significantly to EsportsGG&apos;s remarkable growth.

        My versatility extends to Salesforce, C#, and other technologies, which
        I expertly utilized during my tenure at RevLocal. Equipped with a strong
        passion for crafting exceptional user experiences, I am eager to embark
        on new opportunities and collaborate with exceptional individuals and
        teams.
